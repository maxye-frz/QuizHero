# OO Design
> A UML class diagram reflecting the "model" for that iteration only.
> Use a software to draw this (e.g. draw.io) and save the diagram as an image. 
> Upload the image and link it in here using this syntax.

# Wireframe

> This could be a sketch of your user interface. 
> You can draw it with hand and insert it here as an image.

# Iteration Backlog
> List the User Stories that you will implement in this iteration.
- As an instructor, I want to edit the uploaded markdown online, so that I can easily modify the content.
- As an instructor, I want to preview the slides while editing the markdown, so that I can better organize the content in the slides.


# Tasks
> A tentative list of the "to do" in order to successfully complete this iteration. This list will change and it is good to keep it updated. It does not need to be exhastive.

- Create an edit page with a text box no the left and a real time rendered preview on the right.
- The instructor can open an previous uploaded markdown file from the history page, then (link to edit page) edit it.
- The instructor can commit the change on the edit page to the backend: update the previous uploaded one or create a new one.

# Tasks
